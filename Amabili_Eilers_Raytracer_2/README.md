### Assignment #4 - Raytracer 2 - Shaders and Texture Mapping - Computer Graphics course - 
made by Lorenzo Amabili(p281542) and Pieter Jan Eilers(s2381575).

## The project consisted of implementing a global lighting simulation using recursive ray tracing. The objective in this section was to produce shadows and to take into account multiple colored light sources, testing whether the rays coming from light sources intersect other objects.
Then, reflections were implemented by using only the specular reflection.
In addition, anti-aliasing was applied by casting multiple rays through a pixel and averaging the resulting colors.
Finally, texture mapping and rotation of shapes were applied too.

## Following the instructions, we completed successfully the implementation of "Optical laws", "Anti-aliasing" and "Texturing".

## Prerequisites
: cmake, building still works the same, we did not add multithreading.
 
## We used a GitHub repository for our project: https://github.com/PJEilers/ComputerGraphics
