### Assignment #2 - Raytracer 1 - Computer Graphics course - made
by Lorenzo Amabili(p281542) and Pieter Jan Eilers(s2381575) .
## The project consisted of producing a 3D scene using a basic ray tracing algorithm, and the implementation of (Phong) illumination will be based on the intersection calculation together with normal calculation. Additional geometries such as a triangle and a plane have been implemented too.
## Following the instructions, we completed successfully the implementation of "Raycasting with spheres & Phong illumination" (i.e., (a) Phong diffuse (b) Full Phong (c) Scene 2) ), whereas we partially completed the section "Additional geometry and meshes ".

## Prerequisites
: cmake, building still works the same, we did not add multithreading 
## We used a GitHub repository for our project: https://github.com/PJEilers/ComputerGraphics
